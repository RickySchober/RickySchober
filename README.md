### Hi im Ricky
I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Santa Clara University working in the SCU Robotic Systems Labratory. I am currently looking trying to grow my skills in my areas of interest such as Robotics, Machine Learning, and Game Development while looking for fulltime employment.

My pinned repos contain some group and personal projects that I have worked on extensively over the past few years.
